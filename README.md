We introduce GTSinger, a large Global, multi-Technique, free-to-use, high-quality singing corpus with realistic music scores, designed for all singing tasks, along with its benchmarks.

We provide the corpus and processing codes for our dataset and benchmarks' implementation in this repository. 

Also, you can visit our [Demo Page](https://gtsinger.github.io/) for the audio samples of our dataset as well as the results of our benchmarks.

## News

- 2024.09: We released the full dataset of GTSinger!
- 2024.09: GTSinger is accepted by NeurIPS 2024 (Spotlight)!
- 2024.05: We released the code of GTSinger!

## TODO List

✅ Release the code.

✅ Release the full dataset.

✅ Release the processed data of Chinese, English, Spanish, German, Russian.

✅ Refine the paired speech data of each language.

✅ Refine Chinese, Spanish, German, Russian annotations.

🔲 Further refine English, French, Japanese, Korean, Italian annotations *(planned to be completed by February 2025)*.

🔲 Release the remaining processed data *(planned to be completed by February 2025)*.

## Key Features

- **80.59 hours of singing voices** in GTSinger are recorded in professional studios by skilled singers, ensuring **high quality and clarity**, forming the largest recorded singing dataset.
- Contributed by **20 singers** across **nine widely spoken languages** (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, French, German, and Italian) and all four vocal ranges, GTSinger enables zero-shot SVS and style transfer models to learn diverse timbres and styles.
- GTSinger provides **controlled comparison** and **phoneme-level annotations** of **six singing techniques** (mixed voice, falsetto, breathy, pharyngeal, vibrato, and glissando) for songs, thereby facilitating singing technique modeling, recognition, and control.
- Unlike fine-grained music scores, GTSinger features **realistic music scores** with regular note duration, assisting singing models in learning and adapting to real-world musical composition.
- The dataset includes **manual phoneme-to-audio alignments, global style labels** (singing method, emotion, range, and pace), and **16.16 hours of paired speech**, ensuring comprehensive annotations and broad task suitability.

### Data Architecture

Our dataset is organized hierarchically. 

It presents nine top-level folders, each corresponding to a distinct language. 

Within each language folder, there are five sub-folders, each representing a specific singing technique.

These technique folders contain numerous song entries, with each song further divided into several controlled comparison groups: a control group (natural singing without the specific technique), and a technique group (densely employing the specific technique).

Our singing voices and speech are recorded at a 48kHz sampling rate with 24-bit resolution in WAV format. 

Alignments and annotations are provided in TextGrid files, including word boundaries, phoneme boundaries, phoneme-level annotations for six techniques, and global style labels (singing method, emotion, pace, and range). 

We also provide realistic music scores in musicxml format.

Notably, we provide an additional JSON file for each singing voice, facilitating data parsing and processing for singing models.
